# Target Architecture

While RTIC can currently target all Cortex-m devices there are some key architecture differences that 
users should be aware of. Namely, the absence of Base Priority Mask Register (`BASEPRI`) which lends
itself exceptionally well to the hardware priority ceiling support used in RTIC, in the ARMv6-M and
ARMv8-M-base architectures, which forces RTIC to use source masking instead. For each implementation
of lock and a detailed commentary of pros and cons, see the implementation of
[lock in src/export.rs][src_export].

[src_export]: https://github.com/rtic-rs/rtic/blob/master/src/export.rs

These differences influence how critical sections are realized, but functionality should be the same
except that ARMv6-M/ARMv8-M-base cannot have tasks with shared resources bound to exception
handlers, as these cannot be masked in hardware.

Table 1 below shows a list of Cortex-m processors and which type of critical section they employ.

## Priority Ceiling

This is covered by the [Resources][resources] page of this book.

## Source Masking

Without a `BASEPRI` register which allows for directly setting a priority ceiling in the Nested 
Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC), RTIC must instead rely on disabling (masking) interrupts.
Consider Figure 1 below, showing two tasks A and B where A has higher priority but shares a resource
with B.

```

At time *t1*, task B locks the shared resource by selectively disabling (using the NVIC) all other
tasks which have a priority equal to or less than any task which shares resources with B. In effect
this creates a virtual priority ceiling, mirroring the `BASEPRI` approach. Task A is one such task that shares resources with
task B. At time *t2*, task A is either spawned by task B or becomes pending through an interrupt
condition, but does not yet preempt task B even though its priority is greater. This is because the
NVIC is preventing it from starting due to task A being disabled. At time *t3*, task B
releases the lock by re-enabling the tasks in the NVIC. Because task A was pending and has a higher
priority than task B, it immediately preempts task B and is free to use the shared resource without
risk of data race conditions. At time *t4*, task A completes and returns the execution context to B.

Since source masking relies on use of the NVIC, core exception sources such as HardFault, SVCall,
PendSV, and SysTick cannot share data with other tasks.
